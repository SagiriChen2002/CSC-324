- The database folder which includes the three datasets used.
- A description of the three datasets.
- A timelog folder which includes the time log and chart created in R for the project.
- Two screenshot of the project progress.
- A feedback from Vivero Digital Fellows program

## About the App
- Accessing the App:
    You can either run the source code locally or access the app via this link:  https://haobochen2002.shinyapps.io/CSC-324/
- App Description:
    The app consists of two pages: one map page and one plot page.
    * Map page: This page consists two US maps with a sidebar. One map is about US education level and the other is about COVID-19 cases in US. From the sidebar, users can select the desired attribute to be displayed on the map, inlcuding 
    different education level and COVID-19 cases, deaths and vaccination condition. Additionally, there is also a project 
    statement, a brief introduction of the project and a brief introduction of the attributes.
    * Page Two: This page displays three plots. The first is a scatter plot. Each dot represents a state. The x-axis indicates the education level of each state, with higher numbers indicating higher education level. The y-axis represents the total number of COVID-19-related cases, death and vaccine condition in each state. The choice of attribute can be selected from the sidebar. The second plot is a bar plot. It shows the top ten states with the highest vaccine coverage. The third plot is a bubble plot. It shows the relationship between the number of COVID-19 vaccine distributed and the number of COVID-19 vaccine administered in each state. The size of the bubbles represents the number of COVID-19 deaths in each state.

## Project Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to study the relationship between COVID-19 and education level in US. In other words, I want to see if there is a relationship between the education level of a state and the COVID-19 condition in that state, including the number of cases, deaths and vaccine condition. There are four different education level attributes in the dataset, including the percentage of people with high school diploma, the percentage of people with bachelor degree, the percentage of people with graduate degree and the percentage of people with no high school diploma.


## Data Description
The descriptions of the three datasets are provided in the **Data description.pdf** file and the **Geographical coordinates.shp** file. The three datasets are:
- **us_education_data**: Contains the education level of each state in US.
- **us_states**: Contains total COVID-19 cases, deaths for each state in US at 2023-12-21.
- **cdc_vaccines_distributed_administered_by_jurisdiction**: Contains the daily COVID-19 vaccine condition of each state in US 
- **US_geographic_dataset**: Provides geographical coordinates for each state in US.
